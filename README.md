# PhotonScripts

##About
This repository holds lua script plugins for Photon V4 (http://photongamemanager.com). 
By downloading these scripts and adding them to Photon you can add more sources for game information, cheats, walkthroughs, manuals and patches.

##Submitting your own scripts
All user made scripts are entirely welcome just clone the repository and submit a pull request. Alternatively you can email Customer Support with your script and I can add it for you.

##Organisation
Your script should ideally be named the same as the site that the data is scraped from and MUST have the .lua extension. 
Any extra files that your lua script requires should be placed in the 'Includes' folder and NOT in the same folder as the main script (as then that other file will show up in Photon's interface).

##Examples
There is an example script in the 'Game' folder but you should be able to follow any of the scripts in the other folder so just use them as a starting point
